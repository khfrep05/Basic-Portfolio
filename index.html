<p>Hi Everyone! This is one of the first web pages I made at my coding bootcamp at UCSD Extension. I am excited to learn all I can over the next 6 months, and I look forward to getting to know everyone as well.</p>
<p>I know the class will be challenging, and I will do everything I can to make it through the next 6 months and come out on top.</p>
